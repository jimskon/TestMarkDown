   IV._Course__description_:

 Astudyof Jane Skon many softwaredesign projectathatrequiresplanning,analysis,design,implementation,testingandmaintenance.  Differentmethodsofplanning,definition,requirementsanalysis,andcostestimationareconsidered.  A central component of the course is a semester long team project which engages a team of 3-5 students in the analysis, design, implementation, and documentation of a significant applied project.  The goal of this team project is for the students to engage with the material as they work to solve a real world problem.  These projects are real needs of organizations in the surrounding community (including Gambier, Knox county, and at times, beyond). Prerequisite:SCMP118 Introduction to Programming, SCMP318SoftwareDevelopment or SCMP218 Data Structures or permission of Instructor.

**Midterm and Final exams** :  There will be a midterm and a comprehensive final examination.

**Software Engineering Team Project**. Each student will need to participate on a software engineering team, working through the processes as a team.  As seen in the grading below there are a variety of activities, some team oriented, and some individual.  Participation in all team activities, and completion of individual work is essential to this aspect of the course.  The activities the team engages in will include the following critical phases, with each phase having an associated document, and presentation.

| **Phase** | **Document and presentation** |

| Requirement Engineering | System Requirements Specification |

**Reflection**. An extremely central part of this course is critical reflection, reflection about the processes used, reflections about preparing for meetings with community partners, reflections about the quality and effectiveness of interactions with community partners, reflections about the methods, advantages, and effectiveness of team work, and reflections about the processes of proof reading, critiquing, and unifying the work produced by the team. This is seen below in the reflection component of each phase.

The goal will be to, for each of the phases above, engage in the following reflective activities:

1. Describe: The student will be asked to describe their engagement with the activity.  They will be asked to consider:
  1. How did you prepare before meeting with project principals to gather information for this phase?
  2. Who did you interact with in order to proceed with the assignment? Why with this person?  How useful was the information gathered?
  3. In what ways did you as a team?  In particular, did you divided the work among team member, and if so, how did you divide it?  Alternatively, did you actively work together as a group, and on what parts?
  4. Did team members proof and critique each other&#39;s work? If so, on what aspects/documents?
2. Examine:
  1. How did your interactions with project principals go? Were you appropriately prepared? Did you miss anything important?
  2. Did you use your time, and the time of the project principals effectively as you gather information?  How effective were you in recording the information from these meetings in ways that are useful for moving the projects forward.
  3. Compare and contrast the value of working individually on components of the project verses working together actively as a team.
  4. How effective were you in working together to produce output that was well integrated, complete, and error free? Was there unnecessary duplication of error?
3. Articulate Learning:
  1. What did you learn about preparing for interactions with project principals?  What will do to prepare for future phases to improve effectiveness and productivity of these interactions.
  2. What did you learn about having effective and productive interactions with project principals?  How with you improve record keeping?  How will you prepare for follow-up queries?
  3. What did you learn about effective team work?  Can you categorize and describe the types of work that is best done individually verses done as a team?
  4. How can you work more effectively to check and improve each other&#39;s work, and to better integrate the corporate work product into a unified, cohesive document?
